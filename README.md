# Chelonia README

## About the theme

Chelonia takes its name from the Greek word for turtle — and from Chelonia mydas, the green sea turtle :turtle:.

It's a dark theme inspired by the tranquility of the ocean depths. It blends sea colors, as deep aquamarine tones with warm coral accents, creating a relaxing and visually pleasing environment for coding. Perfect for developers who enjoy an elegant, natural style that reduces eye strain while maintaining clear contrast for readability :ocean:.

## Why I created Chelonia

As a web development student, I'm constantly eager to learn more about UX/UI design — finding ways to make websites and applications more approachable and enjoyable for users while achieving solid, consistent results.\
Since I haven’t had the chance to collaborate or work for any company so far, I thought it would be a cool project to include in my portfolio :smirk:.

I really enjoyed creating this project, and I learned quite a few things along the way — like how `.json` files work, how to build and upload a VS Code extension, and how color choices can completely change the mood of a workspace.

So I hope you enjoy making use of Chelonia as much as I enjoyed making Chelonia!

**Enjoy your coding!** :octocat:
